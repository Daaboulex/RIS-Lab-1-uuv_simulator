##Task1:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
         To do this project, git clone uuv_simulator(https://github.com/my name-is-D/uuv_simulator) packages and build them. You also have to set up the catkin            directory. Important note, have ROS documentation on hand and take note of the used directories. If any packages are missing when running launch files,            just look for the missing file and git clone it into the correct directory.
         In this task we launched uuv_gazebo/rexrov_default.launch and later inspected the nodes, topics, services it launches and the message/service types they          use to communicate.
